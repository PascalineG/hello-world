# hello-world
Hi !
I've always wanted to come into the misterious world of contributors to Open Source projects. Today my goal is just to, at least, understand better how it works so that, one day, if I am brave enough, I might be able to participate to a real project with the community ! But right now, starting this project, is part of proving to myself that I am capable of learning whatever I want, doing whatever I want, even code.
